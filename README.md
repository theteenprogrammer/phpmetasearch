This program written in PHP, HTML and CSS is a Metasearch
A Metasearch is a form of search which compiles the results of search results from multiple sources.
In this Metasearch I have programmed it so that it echos the results of Google, Bing and Yahoo with the adverts removed.
The preview is https://metasearch-yahoo-google-bing.venhubtech.repl.co/
If you want to copy the code please credit me by mentioning that the code was written by The Teen Programmer.
