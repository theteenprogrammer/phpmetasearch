This program written in PHP, HTML and CSS is a Metasearch
A Metasearch is a form of search which compiles the results of search results from multiple sources.
In this Metasearch I have programmed it so that it echos the results of Google, Bing and Yahoo with the adverts removed.

If you want to copy the code please credit me by mentioning that the code was written by The Teen Programmer.
